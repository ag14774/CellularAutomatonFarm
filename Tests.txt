Functionality and design:
use terms from lecture
describe initial tests for most efficient cores
describe best ratios performance-wise and memory-wise
problems regarding reading and output lines(solved by reading/writing bytes) after bit extracted from array
memory problems and bitArray.h(problem with memcpy requiring specified number of bytes, solved by starting from a "fresh" byte for each line)
rle functionality

Tests and Experiments:
-With vs without speedboost(include breeder and image that the system fails)(explain that images that exhibit infinite growth, slow the system down, because more of the cells need to be processed)
-Asynchronous channels vs interfaces
-With vs without tile 1(mention 4 cores in tile0 slower than 2+2)
-Different image ratios for tile 1
//-rotate vs no rotate on small disproportional images
-Read with RLE vs with no RLE
